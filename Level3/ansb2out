Good job! You've successfully used an Ansible playbook to convert
ASCII-encoded text to EBCDIC, and you did it in a way that can be quickly
changed to convert any other data sets you come across.

We're almost to the end of ANSB2, but don't let us stop you from exploring.
You probably noticed TSO command modules, and if you want to run UNIX
commands, you can do that using the regular "Command" module, since the
mainframe is, in this regard, just another platform that can be easily
automated through modern tools. Read up on that here, it *might* come in
handy for the last step:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/command_module.html

To finish this challenge, you need to (you guessed it) created another
playbook. This one will:
1) Take this text
2) Move it over to your home directory on the mainframe(not your local system)
The name of the file should be ansb2out
so the full path of the file will be (/z/zxxxxx/ansb2out)
3) Insert a message, or a quote, or just something you want to say at the
bottom of the file. Keep it clean (we do read these things) and be sure
to include your userid in that message somewhere.

BTW, a tip for that third item, don't spend too much time trying to use
z/OS utilities to insert your message and username. Focus instead on the
core "Command" module.

One last tip, remember that record lengths are a thing, and if you go beyond
the record length, you'll have to start a new line, otherwise it won't fit
into that data set member. It's easier to forget about that when writing
text as opposed to code.

When you've got your playbook working to produce the output requested above,
enter the command to finish this challenge (ANSB2) however you like.

You've accomplished so much through this series of challenges, and we hope
that you've learned a lot, but we also hope you had some fun along the way.
Don't stop here. Figure out where you need to go to grow and learn.
The people who go the furthest in this contest, and in life, do not avoid
challenges. They seek new and inventive ways to solve them.
Here's to the problem-solvers.
